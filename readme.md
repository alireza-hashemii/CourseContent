This repository contains teaching files as well as  projects for Python graduates. You can download the code and modify it in any way you feel will help you understand better. Finally, I would like to remind you that the creation and improvement of these files is the result of the efforts of me and my friends at the Tehran Technical Complex, Fardis branch. I hope you find it useful.


“Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and they make a mess of things.” 
                - Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python
